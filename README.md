# Salary Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to build a salary prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model predicts the salary of individuals based on various features such as education, years of experience, job role, etc. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical salary data, which can be accessed from the following link:

[Salary Data Dataset](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Salary%20Data.csv)

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

3. Run the main script to train the model and make predictions.

```bash
python salary_prediction.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to input values for the features (education, experience, etc.) for which you want to predict the salary.

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing

- The dataset is loaded using the `pandas` library from the provided link.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.

### Model Training

- A machine learning model, such as linear regression, is trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict the salary.
- Model evaluation techniques, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are used to assess the performance of the trained model.

### Prediction

- Once the model is trained, users can input their own values for the features to predict their salary.
- The model will output a predicted salary based on the provided input.

## File Structure
